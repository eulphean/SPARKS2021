# SPARKS 2021
In 2021, Amay Kataria was invited to give an artist talk about his work [Momimsafe](https://amaykataria.com/#/momimsafe) at [SPARKS](https://dac.siggraph.org/sparks/) (SIGGRAPH's Digital Arts Community). This work is created around Momimsafe to give an artist lecture called [Yearning for Intimacy](https://vimeo.com/511376941#t=29m05s) with an interactive [website](https://amaykataria.com/SPARKS2021/). 

### About Momimsafe
Since its inception in 2020, Momimsafe has asked “how have our interpersonal relationships with friends, family, and loved ones
been affected?” The tactility of intimacy has been tattered and strength of the internet has been put to a test...the pandemic
has inspired artists and creative practitioners to innovate alternate forms to achieve intimacy, connection, and togetherness.
